Financial Analysis Swat Team Overview
=====================================

## The Plan
1. Identify the top 5 industries by market cap
2. Find the top 2 companies in those industries (so a total of 10 companies)
3. Break down their cost buckets and their top customers
4. Compare 2019-2020 1st quarter, calculate growth and % of revenue
5. Identify if these cost buckets are essential vs non essential and prioritize them which are first to go when revenue drops and identify from whom and why revenues are dropping in the first place
6. Do this for their customers and their customers customers and find patterns/conduct analysis on which companies make up the largest cost buckets (except employees) that will be the first to cut (meaning the costs that the companies are paying that are first to cut is revenue from another company that is about to be cut)
7. Then you follow the money and figure out how the dominoes fall

#### $3.02T - Software
- $1280B - Microsoft
- $1170B - Apple

#### $2.45T - Pharmaceuticals
- $395B - Johnson & Johnson

#### $2.25T - Banks
- $271B - JP Morgan Chase
- Can't find - as of late 2019 Forbes lists Bank of America as ahving a mkt. cap of $287B, but as of today their mkt. cap is $1B
Note: From what I could tell, Visa (Mkt. cap $345B) is classified as "Financial Services", and not as a bank

#### $2.15T - Internet & Direct Marketing Retail
- $366B - Walmart

#### $1.75T - IT Services
