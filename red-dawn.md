Financial Analysis Swat Team Overview
=====================================

## Overview
FOLLOW THE MONEY! We'll look at the top 5 industries in the world by market cap, and will be looking into the top 2 companies in those industries (so a total of 10 companies). These businesses are going to make cuts and are likely loosing revenue. So when they do, whatever costs they cut is either revenue for other companies (products or services they're using that they won't pay for anymore), or employees salaries. We'll also be analyzing growth rations, how cash position will affect companies abilities to survive, and what are some things that will stay the same and other that will inevitably change. We'll be adapting along the way based on what we find.

## The Plan
1. Identify the top 5 industries by market cap
2. Find the top 2 companies in those industries (so a total of 10 companies)
3. Break down their cost buckets and their top customers
4. Compare 2019-2020 1st quarter, calculate growth and % of revenue
5. Identify if these cost buckets are essential vs non essential and prioritize them which are first to go when revenue drops and identify from whom and why revenues are dropping in the first place
6. Do this for their customers and their customers customers and find patterns/conduct analysis on which companies make up the largest cost buckets (except employees) that will be the first to cut (meaning the costs that the companies are paying that are first to cut is revenue from another company that is about to be cut)
7. Then you follow the money and figure out how the dominoes fall
