# Are you solving the right problem?
[Article](https://hbr.org/2012/09/are-you-solving-the-right-problem)

Note: _Pay particular attention to the first half of the article (from the introduction through the first of the four steps Spradlin establishes for defining a problem). We will apply this approach to problem solving in class._

## Four-step Process for Defining Problems
1. **Establish the Need for a Solution:** What is the essential problem? What is the desired outcome? Who will benefit from solving this problem, and how do we help them the most?

2. **Justify the Need:** Will solving the problem serve our strageic goals? What are the benefits to us, and how will we measure them? How can we ensure that a solution is implemented?

3. **Contextualize the Problem:** What approaches have we tried? What have others tried? Have these approaches worked, and if not, why?

4. **Write the Problem Statement - It Should Include:** The root cause of the problem, the requirements a solution must meet, and clear economic and emotional incentives.

## Task
**In your own words, summarize the first of the four steps suggested in the Spradlin article. Why is it important to identifying the right problem?**

What is the problem, and what is the desired outcome? Having clarity on what you're actually trying to solve for will allow you to think of a wider range of possible solutions.

Knowing what you're desired outcome is helps you notice when your perception of the problem doesn't actually address its root causes.

For example, if SpaceX defined their core problem poorly such as "want cheaper rocket fuel" and started doing a ton of chemical research. But if they spent time to think about their desired outcome "get the cost per kg of launching cargo into orbit to below $3000" it becomes apparent that making cheaper rocket fuel isn't the only option.

In this case their core problem was "how do we make rocket launches as cheap as possible?" - which is a broader problem, allowing for solutions such as reuasable rockets.

# Be Mindwise: Perspective Taking vs. Perspective Getting
[Article](http://thepsychreport.com/essays-discussion/be-mindwise-perspective-taking-vs-perspective-getting/)

Note: _This article describes the distinction between perspective taking and perspective getting, and the efficacy of each approach in understanding others. In class you will compare both approaches, and will apply perspective getting as a means of understanding your audience._


## Task
**Define perspective taking and perspective getting, and give an example of each. How effective are each of these approaches in understanding others? Explain why.**

**Perspective Taking**
- Perspective taking is where you actively imagine being in another person's circumstances - often in an attempt to gain understanding.
- An example of perspective taking would be if [...]
- Relies on you ability to imagine the other person's perspective accurately.
- Accurately taking perspective is hard. Perspective taking often exaggerates perceived differences (sterotypes) between groups.

**Perspective Getting:**
- Perspective getting is where you attempt to understand somebody by directly asking them for their perspective.
- "Knowing others' minds requires asking and listening, not just reading and guessing."
- Perspective Getting is much more accurate than Perspective Taking. Our imaginations works with limited information, and we don't know what we don't know.
- IDEA: This is why startups spend so much talking to users. Perspective Taking is ineffective when you're trying to build something that people want.

# How much food do we waste?
[Article](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/12/climate/food-waste-emissions.html)

Note: _This article is an overview of the global problem of food waste, the fate of one-third of all the food that is grown. It provides helpful background for an activity in class._

## Notes
- Globally, we throw out 1.3 billion tonnes of food a year, 33% of all food that we grow
- In the US and Canada, 40% of wasted food is thrown out by consumers
- Food waste and loss represents 3.3 billion tonnes of carbon emissions
- Food waste also results in water waste
