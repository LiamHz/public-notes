<h1 id="the-rate-of-fusion">The Rate of Fusion</h1>
<p>If you haven’t read <a href="https://www.briannagopaul.com/fusion-basics.html">The Basics of Fusion</a>, I highly recommend you read it first before continuing on. If not, here’s a quick recap on what you missed:</p>
<p><strong>RECAP</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fusion is the combining of two hydrogen isotopes, often Deuterium and Tritium, to release an immense amount of energy</li>
<li>Binding energy is the amount of energy released when a nuclei is separated into its constituents</li>
<li>The binding energy curve and <span class="math inline">\(E=mc^2\)</span> shows that combining two light nuclei into a nuclei with a higher binding energy releases LOTS of energy</li>
<li>The Coulomb Force, a repulsive force between two like charged particles, prevents nuclei from fusing and increases the closer and closer the two nuclei get together</li>
<li>At a certain distance called the Coulomb Barrier, the nuclear strong force overtakes the Coulomb Force and allows fusion to occur. It’s an attractive short range forces that binds the nucleons (protons and neutrons in a nucleus together)</li>
<li>For a particle to overcome the Coulomb Barrier, an immense amount of energy measured by the coulomb barrier’s height is needed. Sometimes, particles can tunnel through the barrier without enough to energy. Even so, this is what makes fusion difficult.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now that we’ve gone through some of the basics of what fusion is, we’re going to calculate how often fusion occurs.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="average-distance-before-collision">Average Distance Before Collision</h2>
<p>Imagine a stationary Tritium nucleus and a Deuterium nuclei moving towards the Tritium nucleus at a certain velocity <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span>. The Tritium nucleus is the target particle and the Deuterium nucleus is the incident particle.</p>
<div class="wide-image">
<figure>
<img src="1%202%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Rate%20At%20Which%20Fusion%20Occurs%20e7caf2ae879d45d18f3554c258313566/Screen_Shot_2020-07-28_at_12.34.12_PM.png" alt="" /><figcaption>In this example there are multiple target and incident particles, this is just for visual purposes</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Each target particle takes up a circular cross sectional area <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>.</p>
<p>If the incident particle passes through the cross sectional area <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, then fusion occurs and this reaction is called a collision. If the incident particle does not, fusion will not occur.</p>
<p>You would initially think that if the target particle has a really large cross sectional area <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, then the probability of a fusion reaction occurring would increase as well right? That’s correct - but we’re going to see exactly how the cross sectional area <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is related to the probability of a collision occurring by calculating the Mean Free Path. The Mean Free Path is the average distance a particle travels before fusion occurs. It’ll take some steps to calculate this but bear with me.</p>
<p><strong>The Mean Free Path</strong> (insert link to other part here)</p>
<p><img src="1%202%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Rate%20At%20Which%20Fusion%20Occurs%20e7caf2ae879d45d18f3554c258313566/Screen_Shot_2020-07-27_at_8.10.47_PM.png" /></p>
<p>Before we calculate the Mean Free Path, we’ll calculate the probability of Deuterium and Tritium fusing in the cylinder above.</p>
<p>First, I’ll explain the image:</p>
<p>There’s a cylinder filled with target particles (Tritium nuclei) that each have a cross sectional area <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>.</p>
<p>The cross sectional area of the cylinder is <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and the width of the cylinder is <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span>. From this, we know that the volume of the entire cylinder is <span class="math inline">\(V=Adx\)</span></p>
<p>If the density of the target particles in the cylinder is <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span>, then the total number of particles in the cylinder would be <span class="math inline">\(N_1=n_1V=n_1Adx\)</span> (the density of the particles x volume of the cylinder)</p>
<p>If we wanted to know the fraction of the total area blocked by target particles it would be <span class="math inline">\(dF =\frac{\sigma N_1}{A}= \frac {\sigma n_1 A dx}{A} = n_1dx\sigma\)</span>. We just took the total area the target particles take up and divided it by the cross sectional area of the sphere which gave us the area that the target particles take up in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, the area of the cylinder.</p>
<p>We can use <span class="math inline">\(dF\)</span> to calculate the probability of an incident particle fusing when it crosses <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span> by simply dividing it by <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\frac {dF}{dx} = \frac {n_1dx\sigma}{dx}= n_1\sigma\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>What does this tell us about the probability of an incident particle fusing with a target particle?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If the target particles have a larger cross sectional area <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, then the probability of fusion occurring increases. Likewise, if the target particle has a smaller cross sectional area <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>, then the probability of fusion decreases</li>
<li>If the density of the target particles in the cylinder <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> increases, the probability of fusion also increases. Likewise, if the density is smaller, the probability of fusion will also decrease.</li>
</ul>
<p>This makes sense, imagine throwing a golf ball into a bucket. First, you were given 1 bucket that had an opening with an area of 1cm. Then, you were given 1000 buckets that had openings with area of 5m. In which case, do you think you would have a higher probability of throwing the golf ball in the bucket. Definitely the second case, where the cross sectional area of the opening of each bucket is greater and there is a higher density of buckets.</p>
<p>Finally, we can go on to calculate the Mean Free Path which will.</p>
<p>Let’s say that there are several <em>incident particles</em> with density <span class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span>. Don’t confuse this with <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> which we used to represent the density of the <em>target particles</em>.</p>
<p>We’ll use <span class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span> to calculate the flux <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma\)</span>— this is total number of incident particles crossing the cross sectional Area <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, per unit time per unit area. Don’t get impatient, we’re going to use this quantity to calculate the Mean Free Path shortly.</p>
<p>To calculate the flux, we took the total number of incident particles <span class="math inline">\(N_2\)</span> and divided by area <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and time <span class="math inline">\(dt\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Gamma = \frac{N_2}{Adt}=\frac{n_2Avdt}{Adt}=n_2v\]</span></p>
<p>This is just total number of incident particles, what portion of these particles are having a collision and fusing? We’ll represent the amount of particles that will fuse with <span class="math inline">\(d\gamma\)</span>. It’s equal to the probability that particles will fuse multiplied by the flux (total number of incident particles per area per time) Simple right?</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[d\gamma = dF\Gamma = \sigma n_1 \Gamma dx \]</span></p>
<p>From this, we can also figure out the number of particles that are not having a collision and thus, not fusing.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[d\Gamma = -\sigma n_1 \Gamma dx\]</span></p>
<p>The Ordinary Differential Equation that describes the [], is:**Note this may not be an ODE, spend some more time understanding this</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\Gamma = \Gamma_0 e^{\frac{-x}{\gamma_m}}\]</span></p>
<p>where, The Mean Free Path is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\gamma_m = \frac{1}{n_1\sigma }\]</span></p>
<p><strong>What Does This Tell Us About The Mean Free Path?</strong></p>
<p>First, the Mean Free Path describes the average distance a particle must travel before a collision or fusion occurs.</p>
<ul>
<li>The equation tells us that as the density and the cross sectional area of the target particle increases, the distance the nuclei must travel before fusion occurs decreases. If the density and cross sectional area of the target particle decreases, the nuclei must travel a longer distance before collision can occur.</li>
<li>It also shows the ‘e-folding decay length of the incident flux that has not undergo a collision’. Put in plain English, it means that the mean free path of an incident particle that has not undergone collision decreases by a factor of <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span></li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h3 id="how-often-does-fusion-occur">How Often Does Fusion Occur?</h3>
<p>Let’s look at how often collisions occur and the average amount of time it takes for a collision to occur.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(v_m\)</span> represents the Collision frequency</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\tau_m\)</span> represents the mean time between collisions</p>
<p>The Mean free path told us that a particle will travel a distance <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_m\)</span> before having a collision.</p>
<p>So the average time a collision takes to occur is the average distance before a collision <span class="math inline">\(\gamma_m\)</span> divided by how often collisions occur <span class="math inline">\(v_m\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\tau_m = \frac{\gamma_m}{v_m}=\frac{1}{n_1\sigma v}\]</span></p>
<p>This should make sense — Nuclear Physics aside, assume you were trying to calculate the distance a car travels if it was driving at 5m/s for 20m. We would take the distance travelled divided by the speed to get <span class="math inline">\(20/5\frac{m}{s}\)</span><span class="math inline">\(=4m\)</span>. We just did the same calculation but with different variables :)</p>
<p>This tell us that the if we were to increase the density of the target particles, the cross sectional area of those particles and their velocity, the time between collisions would decrease.</p>
<p>The Collision frequency <span class="math inline">\(v_m\)</span> is also a relatively simple calculation:</p>
<p>It’s just the inverse of the average time before a collision occurs.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[v_m = \frac{1}{\tau_m}=n_1\sigma v\]</span></p>
<p>In this case, let’s say we increased the density of the target particles, their cross sectional areas <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> and their velocities, the collision frequency would increase. The opposite is also true.</p>
<p>If this doesn’t click immediately, imagine you had two identical boxes of cats. Box #1 had 50 fat cats moving super fast. Box #2 had 2 skinny cats, barely moving. In which box, would the cats hit each other the least? Although box #1 would be the funniest to watch, box #2 would definitely have the least number of colliding kitties. 😸Just like how the collision frequency of nuclei increases if there are more nuclei, the nuclei are larger in cross sectional area and the nuclei are moving at faster speeds.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="fusion-power-energy-density">Fusion Power Energy Density</h3>
<p>The reaction rate <span class="math inline">\(R_{12}\)</span> tells us how many times fusion occurs per unit time per unit volume. By calculating the reaction rate, we can then figure out how much energy fusion outputs per volume. This is important because it’ll let us know if the fusion reactions we’re using are capable of producing net positive energy … which is the entire point of using fusion energy in the first place. To produce immense amounts of clean energy.</p>
<p>We’ll start with the basics:</p>
<p>In time <span class="math inline">\(dt=\frac{dx}{v}\)</span> (this is time = distance particles travel / velocity) <span class="math inline">\(n_2Adx\)</span> particles will pass through the target volume. Just to refresh your memory, the total number of particles passing through the target volume is the density of those particles <span class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span> multiplied by the cross sectional area of the cylinder <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> multiplied by the width of the cylinder <span class="math inline">\(dx\)</span>. All we did here is take the volume of the space the particles are in multiplied by the density of those particles in that space to find the total number of particles. If this isn’t clicking, check <a href="https://www.notion.so/briannago/1-The-Basics-of-Fusion-Energy-f6c070a161cf4401bb2f322da1e4658f#76e9e719bb464e7ca6fa79ae4aa64d9e">here</a> to refresh your memory.</p>
<p>The number of particles that will actually have a collision is the probability of having a collision <span class="math inline">\(dF\)</span> multiplied by the total number of particles <span class="math inline">\(n_2Adx\)</span>. → <span class="math inline">\(dF(n_2Adx)\)</span> So if there’s a higher probability of having a collision or a greater number of total particles, the number of particles having a collision will increase.</p>
<p>The reaction rate <span class="math inline">\(R_{12}\)</span> is the number of particles having a collision <span class="math inline">\(dF(n_2Adx)\)</span> divided by the total Volume of the space the particles are in <span class="math inline">\(A dx\)</span> and the time <span class="math inline">\(dt\)</span>. The reaction rate is telling us how many fusion collisions are occurring per unit volume per time.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R_{12} = \frac{dF(n_2Adx)}{Adxdt}=\sigma n_1 n_2 \frac{dx}{dt}=\sigma v n_1 n_2 \]</span></p>
<p>Let’s say that each fusion reaction creates some energy <span class="math inline">\(E_f\)</span>, then the total energy produced in this reaction per unit volume is <span class="math inline">\(E_fR_{12}\)</span></p>
<p>Therefore, the power density of that fusion reaction in <span class="math inline">\(Watts/m^3\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(S_f = E_fR_{12}=E_f n_1\sigma n_2 v\)</span></p>
<p>Now we can start to see how everything is related.</p>
<p><strong>Let’s test what you learned from this section:</strong></p>
<details>
<p><summary> What would happen to the power density if I increased the density of the particles?</p>
</summary> First, more fusion collisions would be occurring per in that space so the reaction rate <span class="math inline">\(R_{12}\)</span> increases. Since the reaction rate increases, the power energy density <span class="math inline">\(S_j\)</span> also increases. We would be producing more power per unit volume because more fusion collisions occur.
</details>
<details>
<p><summary> What would happen to the power density if the cross section of the nuclei decreased?</p>
</summary> If the cross sectional area of the nuclei <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> decreased, the number of collisions occurring in that volume of space <span class="math inline">\(R_{12}\)</span> would decrease because there’s less available area for the particles to collide at. This would then decrease the power energy density <span class="math inline">\(S_j\)</span> because less fusion collisions are occurring per unit volume.
</details>
<details>
<p><summary> What would happen to power density if the velocity of the particles was 0?</p>
</summary> The power density would be 0 then, we would be producing no energy. If you were to set all the <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> terms to 0, the reaction rate <span class="math inline">\(R_{12}\)</span> would equal 0. Plugging this into <span class="math inline">\(S_j\)</span>, we would get 0 as well. Particles need to be moving for for any collision to occur. If you wanted to count how many cars crashed on a highway but none of the cars were moving, then there would be 0 collisions right? Same thing for fusion, particles must be moving at a non zero velocity at least.
</details>
<p><br/></p>
<p>In every equation you’ve seem above, the velocity of the particles <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> has remained constant. In a real nuclear reactor, this definitely wouldn’t be the case. Particles would be moving at various speeds depending on how energetic they are.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="modifying-the-reaction-rate">Modifying The Reaction Rate</h3>
<p>We need a way to include all the different velocities of particles in our reaction rate <span class="math inline">\(R_{12}=n_1n_2\sigma v\)</span></p>
<p>To do this we can create a function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> that tells us the density of the particles but has all the information about the varying velocities of these particles. This is different from our normal density variable <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> that only included one velocity <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> to describe the velocity of all the particles.</p>
<p>I’ll walk you through this function using this scenario:</p>
<p>We have a small cubic volume of space <span class="math inline">\(dr=dxdydz\)</span></p>
<p>The total number of particles at a specific time <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> using our simpler density variable <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> would be <span class="math inline">\(n(r,t)dr\)</span>. The density is a function of the time and the volume of the cube space we’re looking at.</p>
<p>Instead of looking at all the particles, how would we find a specific group of particles that have a certain velocity. Let’s say there are 6 groups of velocities:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(v_x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_x + dv_x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(v_y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_y + dv_y\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(v_z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(v_z + dv_y\)</span>.</p>
<p><img src="1%202%20%E2%80%94%20The%20Rate%20At%20Which%20Fusion%20Occurs%20e7caf2ae879d45d18f3554c258313566/Screen_Shot_2020-07-28_at_12.26.22_PM.png" /></p>
<p>To include all these velocity subgroups in our density function <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, we can take the 3 dimensions we were originally working in <span class="math inline">\(dr=dxdydz\)</span> and instead upgrade it to a 6 dimensional space to include all the velocities. First, understand that <span class="math inline">\(drdv=(dzdydz)\cdot (dv_z dv_y dv_x)\)</span> ← 6 dimensions. The density function then looks like this: <span class="math inline">\(f(r,v,t)drdv\)</span></p>
<p>Now we can find the total number of particles in a certain velocity group, let’s say <span class="math inline">\(dv\)</span> by integrating over all the velocities and dividing it by the cubic volume <span class="math inline">\(dr=dxdydz\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[n(r,t) = \frac {dxdydz\int fdv_xdv_ydv_z}{dxdydz}=\int fdv\]</span></p>
<p>If we wanted to calculate the specific average velocity of a particle at <span class="math inline">\(dr\)</span>. We would do the following:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Choose the subset of velocities <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span></li>
<li>Multiply by the number of particles moving at the velocity</li>
<li>Integrate over all possible values of <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span></li>
<li>Divide by the total number of particles in <span class="math inline">\(dr\)</span></li>
</ol>
<p><span class="math display">\[u(r,t)= \frac {dr \int vfdr}{ndr}=\frac {1}{n}\int vfdv\]</span></p>
<p>We can finally generalize the reaction rate <span class="math inline">\(R_{12}\)</span> to include multiple velocities.</p>
<p>Remember that <span class="math inline">\(R_{12}= n_1n_2\sigma v\)</span> with one velocity <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> for all the particles</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Replace the density of the target particles <span class="math inline">\(n_1\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(f_1(r,v_2,t)dv_1\)</span></li>
<li>Replace the density of the incident particles <span class="math inline">\(n_2\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(f(r,v_2,t)dv_2\)</span></li>
<li>Replace <span class="math inline">\(v\)</span> with a relative velocity <span class="math inline">\(\mid v_2 - v_1 \mid\)</span> which is the difference in velocity between the incident particles and the target particles</li>
<li>Let <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> = <span class="math inline">\(\sigma(\mid v_2 - v_1\mid)\)</span>. This makes cross section directly related to the velocity between incident and target particles.</li>
</ol>
<details>
<summary><b> What does this mean? </summary></b> The velocity between the target and incident particles is very small, the cross section of those particles is also very small. What’s actually happening here is that when the velocities of incident and target particles is small, the coulomb force deflects the orbits of these particles and prevents the particles from getting close to each other to make a collision. Which is why we need the target and incident particle to be travelling at high velocities so that the Coulomb Force can have less influence on the particles and allow them to fuse.
</details>
<p><br/></p>
<p><strong>Final Generalized Reaction Rate</strong></p>
<p>Substituting all the variables above, we finally have a reaction rate that tells us the number of particles colliding given the varying velocities of target and incident particles.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R_{12} = \int f_1(v_1)f_2(v_2)\sigma(\mid v_2 - v_1 \mid) \mid v_2 - v_1 \mid dv_1 dv_2\]</span></p>
