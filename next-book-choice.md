# From Darwin to Hitler: Evolutionary Ethics, Eugenics, and Racism in Germany
- Why this book in specific? Was it recommended by somebody?
- Worried that it's dry / might read like a textbook.

# War Against the Weak: Eugenics and America's Campaign to Create a Master Race
- Was this recommended, or are you just looking for a book on eugenics?
- Looks intersting / well reviewed. I'd (possibly) be down.
- "This is the most complete reference book on any subject that I've read" --> Think on this + look for more concise (less than 600 pages) + highly reviewed books on eugenics

# Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware and Software
- Recommended as a must read by lots of legit CS people (founder of StackExchange, graphics peeps etc)
- Covers the history of hardware, and the technicals of how things like logic gates, processors, and pixels work on a low-level
- I think this will be really good for learning stuff, but maybe not thought-provoking?
- "This book takes you from the very basics of how to encode information, such as how binary is used to represent complex information, to understanding how a computer uses information like this to perform intricate operations. "
- If you're interested in computer architecture, then this has my strong vote. Otherwise I'm fine with something else.

# The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life
- Written by the guy who wrote "A Nihilist's View on Meaning"
- Covers two topics: self-deception (self-rationalization, motive hiding etc) and social signallig (why we do charity, art, education etc)
- Summarizes other people's research to drive their thesis

# Interaction Ritual: Essays on Face-to-Face Behavior
- Recommended by the guy who wrote "A Nihilist's View on Meaning"
- Talks about the unconcious social rituals people practice
- People say its dry and dense
